-Only need 1 file for collecting data and outputting schedules
-Potentially another for communicating with the front-end

To Do:
-Get the data from Testudo
-Write the brute force algorithm to create all schedules
-Output schedule info as text to test
-Create front-end to manipulate the class data
-Add additional options to filter out undesired schedules
-Pick classes closest to a certain location/optimizing schedules for distance
-Filter out undesired buildings
-Write README once complete
